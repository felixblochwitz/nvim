# My Own NeoVim Config

##### TODO:
Language Support:
- html / css -> emmet
- javascrip -> typescriptserver, prettier
- python -> black, isort
- scala -> nvim-metals (rabbit hole, might want to do later)
- markdown -> pandoc, see what else we can achieve here

General Plugins:
- treesitter
- telescope
- harpoon
- nvim-tree / neotree (leaning towards nvim-tree right now)
- git plugins to integrate git better
- better status line

Other stuff:
- make code actions and everything work for pyright
- python documentation creation (maybe neogen)
- rebuild theme picker from nvchad
